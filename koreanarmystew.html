            <p>In Korea, a hot pot of Budae Jjigae, or Korean army stew, often takes center stage at dinner. It’s another must-try dish from the nation’s rich culinary tradition.</p> </h2>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <h2>Essential</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Spam: Opt for low-sodium</li>
            <li>Pork & beans: An integral part for that signature taste.</li>
            <li>Hot dogs and/or sausage: more processed meat to make it hearty and add umami flavor.</li>
            <li>Kimchi: Sour kimchi is what makes this stew “fusion”</li>
            <li>Stock: Chicken stock lends depth; alternatively, try anchovy kelp stock.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Optional</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Protein: Pork belly or ground pork.</li>
            <li>Tofu: Soft tofu, it soaks in flavors brilliantly.</li>
            <li>Instant ramen noodles: Preferably Korean ramen noodles.</li>
            <li>Cheese: Cheddar’s my pick, but American cheese works too</li>
            <li>Aromatics: Onions, green onions.</li>
            <li>Mushroom: Any mushroom of your choice. I used oyster mushroom.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Seasoning Sauce</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Korean chili flakes (gochugaru): Adjust the amount depending on your heat tolerance</li>
            <li>Korean chili paste (gochujang): adds savory taste and thicken the broth</li>
            <li>Soy sauce and soup soy sauce: adds umami and seasoning</li>
            <li>Garlic: savory addition</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Tips along the way</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Make your budae jjigae in a large, shallow pan to hold all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I usually opt for store-bought chicken stock which saves time.</li>
            <li>Cook your Korean stew on a portable burner right at the table, and have people pick out what they like to eat while the stew is simmering. (Most of the ingredients don’t take long to cook)</li>
            <li>Remember, noodles absorb liquid. Consume the noodles first and refill with extra stock if needed. It’s the traditional way at Korean restaurants!</li>

        </ol>
        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Blend the chili flakes, gochujang, soy sauces, garlic, and pepper. Keep aside.</li>
            <li>Begin with onions at the pan’s base, then arrange your choice of ingredients.</li>
            <li>Add noodles, cheese, and the prepared sauce. Pour stock just enough to cover the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Place the pan on the stove (I recommend using a portable burner right on the table) and bring the stew to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer.</li>
            <li>Stir the seasoning paste to distribute it throughout the stew.</li>
            <li>Stir ramen noodles to cook evenly in the simmering stock.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>How to Eat</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Noodles First: Dive into the noodles while they’re still chewy; they tend to absorb the broth and can get too soft if left for long.</li>
            <li>Temperature Matters: Serving the stew piping hot straight from the stove enhances its aroma and overall taste.</li>
            <li>Pairings: For a wholesome experience, pair the stew with a side of steamed rice. The rice complements the savory broth and makes for a filling meal.</li>
            <li>Accompaniments: Consider serving with traditional Korean side dishes, like kimchi or pickled radish, to elevate the dining experience. They add a refreshing contrast to the rich, hearty stew.</li>
        </ol>
