## Introduction

Welcome to the README page for this HTML project. This project serves as a practical demonstration of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) skills and knowledge. By completing this project, you will have demonstrated proficiency in the following key areas:

1. **HTML Structure:** You will learn how to structure web content using HTML, including the proper use of headings, paragraphs, lists, and other essential HTML elements.

2. **Semantic HTML:** Gain an understanding of semantic HTML and its importance in creating accessible and SEO-friendly web pages. Learn how to use semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.

3. **Forms:** Create interactive forms using HTML's form elements, including input fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and select dropdowns. Learn to handle form submissions and validation.

4. **Links and Navigation:** Understand how to create hyperlinks to navigate between different web pages and external websites. Learn about relative and absolute paths.

5. **Images and Multimedia:** Learn how to integrate images and multimedia elements like audio and video into web pages using HTML.

6. **HTML Tables:** Create tables for organizing and presenting tabular data. Learn how to define table headers, rows, columns, and style tables effectively.

7. **HTML5 Features:** Explore modern HTML5 features such as `<canvas>` for graphics, `<audio>` and `<video>` for multimedia, and `<svg>` for scalable vector graphics.

8. **Accessibility:** Ensure that the HTML code complies with accessibility standards by adding appropriate attributes and semantic markup to make web content accessible to all users.

9. **Responsive Design:** Apply responsive web design principles using CSS media queries to make web pages adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following components:

Will progress from HTML to CSS to JS

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the starting point of the project.
- `css/`: A directory containing Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling the HTML content.
- `images/`: A folder for storing image files used within the project.
- `scripts/`: If necessary, this directory can contain JavaScript files to add interactivity and functionality to the project.

## Getting Started

To explore this project and the HTML code, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can also host it on a web server to access it online or make modifications and extensions according to your requirements.
